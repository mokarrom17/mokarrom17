## Hi there 👋  
I’m Mokarrom, a software engineer based in Bangladesh.

My primary focus is full-stack web development using the MERN stack,
with strong emphasis on React, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS.
I complement development with UI design using Figma and concept sketching in Procreate.

This GitHub profile showcases small projects, experiments,
and ongoing work — all built from scratch as part of my learning
and professional growth.
